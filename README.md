# JavaScript Arrays  
### Description  
The project loops through two different arrays- one featuring dinosarus, one featuring fake projects.  
On page load, cards featuring the fake assignments and some info about the dinosaurs print in a column to the page.  
The cards were formed by using a for loop to iterate over the arrays and retrieve information to build into an HTML string.  
Those cards were then printed to the DOM in a selected div.
